### 1. Adapter Design Pattern
        A. Concept
            * it is more like a plug adaptor
            * convert interface into another interface
            * connections to legacy app to new app
        
        B. Design
            * it is client centric
            * it integrates with old application
            * utilize interface, but not required
            
        C. Pitfalls
            * Don't complicate
            * can implement multiple adapters
            * don't add functionality to adapters
